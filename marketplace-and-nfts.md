# Marketplace & NFTs

The FlappyDoge NFTs marketplace will consist of different dog breed skins that will be launched as a mystery box with a random generated code and a limited set amount of NFTs ever to be created it grants the ability for players and traders to show off their skins and or swap them around and use the ability of the marketplace to make an digital income.

In regards to the Metaverse part experience of the game all purchases and transactions will be made with $FLPD token this is important for the ecosystem to grow and to benefit users and holders of $FLPD.

The ecosystem will create inclusiveness and allow new users to still “get into” the game by incorporating NFT leasing. The platform will create a leaser and lessee matching system for NFT enhancements that can allow users to access NFTs and enhance their gameplay to explore and expand their FlappyDoge experience

Finally, the games will integrate into the NFT and FlappyDoge ecosystem such that successful progress in one game can be translated into other games.  Now newer users can develop a skillset in the newer game that allows them to compete in older games—a previous issue in other successful games where new users can never “catch up” to other players.
