# Metaverse

&#x20;The metaverse of FlappyDoge will be cartoon-like in its overall look and theme, with plans to debut a trailer and beta-version by the end of 2022. Within the FlappyDoge metaverse ecosystem, one can buy, sell, and trade land, with the added ability to create on your land. But what makes this standout is the FlappyDoge metaverse will bridge portals through a centralized system. As an example, FlappyDoge players would log-in using their wallet, and within the game they can go through a portal which leads them into another project/company’s metaverse space to explore, play, trade, etc.

With this further utility expansion of FlappyDoge, we would be able to facilitate meme projects that are decentralized to give them utility within our centralized metaverse by creating games in which their users can earn $FLPD or their own native token. The way we can do this is by bridging systems and folders together so players of 2 communities can engage with one another. This bridge will be a ‘two-way street’ and will be in an extensive beta phase to work through any bugs that the team/community/users would report.

As FlappyDoge grows, it will expeditiously progress through the development of an online Lobby that is VR enabled. Although it can be played with or without VR capabilities. FlappyDoge will mirror previous successful concepts, like Club Penguin, with real NFTs and loot box marketplaces.

Other ways to earn and utilize FlappyDoge tokens will include, but not be limited to: • An online social structure where players can compete against each other, and even wager additional amounts on the battle. • A Trophy Class system that represents the total amount of high score coins you collected, allowing players to earn additional rewards for elite gameplay. • Weekly and quarterly tournament play for players to compete. • Bonus elements as gameplay levels are extended • Easter Eggs • NFT Loot Boxes • Online Lobby • VR Lobby

Here is a flow-chart of all the possible revenues to be seen in the metaverse for FlappyDoge and partners who decide to join.
