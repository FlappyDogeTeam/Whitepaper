# Multi-Chain Strategy

FlappyDoge will work across EVM and non-EVM compatible chains. We already have BSC. We will be working other chains such as eth, cardano, solana and Polygon.

We are working on cross-chain advertising and purchasing of data facilitated via cross-chain oracles that will allow for the transaction handshake to be done between chains and allow for the data to be verified and transacted as well as for the mint/burn of chain native tokens to balance the chain specific token repositories (i.g. burning of Polygon tokens and minting of BSC tokens and vice versa as data is transacted across chains). This will be our Cross-Chain Architecture initiative.
