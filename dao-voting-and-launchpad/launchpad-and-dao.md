# LaunchPad & Dao

FlappyDoge goes beyond simply an addictive, fun game, with an NFT Marketplace Ecosystem and a play-to-earn IOS/Android game Launch Pad run via DAO governance.

The launchpad DAO voting system is based on community projects. Users must own 5000$ of equivalent of FLPD which users can vote on the next community game which incentivises the owners of FLPD.

The launchpad created will be used for FLPD holders, again what it will do is users must own 5000$ of FLPD to be whitelisted into community pre-sales users and also purchasing with BNB or equivalent in chosen stable coin.

The launch pad system will introduce the line of up of future games of Play 2 Earn (P2E) games. Every time a new game is announced, FlappyDoge token holders will receive an airdrop of the specific new gaming token and a threshold will be set in place so that users can participate in the sales.  Via DAO Governance will also have the ability to decide which games will join the ecosystem, helping grow the metaverse with high-quality inclusions.

With a launch pad system in place, loyal token holders will have the chance to accumulate new game tokens and be included in new, enjoyable P2E games similar in scope to FlappyDoge.

This LaunchPad allows game developers to leverage FlappyDoge’s user network to increase adoption while helping FlappyDoge token holders by vetting games for them.  Only games with significant development and strong playability that will merge with the current Ecosystem will be included, making sure that users don’t have to sort through the endless number of games out there to find ones that they enjoy.&#x20;
