Please note that marketing will be integrated as needed. It is a critical and expected step that will be implemented at the marketing teamâ€™s discretion, as it relates to the FlappyDoge chain of events. However, it is intentionally not indicated in the stated roadmap, because marketing is contingent on several variables that cannot always be predicted. Please check any social media posts and/or news articles to learn about our past, present, and future marketing initiatives.
