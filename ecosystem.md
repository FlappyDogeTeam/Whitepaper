# Ecosystem

With FlappyDoge expansion towards meme projects and other P2E games we are giving them the power by giving us their character game files so players who do sign up with an email account when they choose to create their own avatar they can support their own projects by having a customisable skin. If for example a meme project does not have a character file for us to implement we can do that for them as a cost and register NFTs for them aswell. With projects joining they have a beneficial way to earn money to help them with their project development or to fund developers.

This is done by offering NFTs for set avatars for example their a dragon token and user X wants to buy an NFT from FlappyDoge for their dragon to make it look cool, the partnership with dragon token will result to them earning the 60% of the NFT sale
