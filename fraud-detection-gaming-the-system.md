# Fraud Detection — “Gaming” the system

As with any gaming company, especially with this being a P2E game, we are prepared for fraud detection and hacks so we will analyze the community by employing community specialists who will seek out "hacks" or programs that may affect the gameplay. We will also implement a ‘verify’ system that will manually check every reward before it is withdrawn to ensure the players who obtained the tokens have obtained them through honest and fair gameplay.
