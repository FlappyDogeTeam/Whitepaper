# What is FlappyDoge

FlappyDoge is a Play2Earn company, just like companies like "Epic Games" we release multiple games but in FlappyDoge we have a dao integration so the community decides what's best for the company in terms of picking games. All games are also to be used with $FLPD as their main token. FLPD will act as the main token for all projects and deliver value and utility. FlappyDoge will also have a NFT/ Marketplace which will be integrated with web 3.0 we believe that users should be able to purchase skins and be able to trade those skins with our players. Finally in the roadmap of FlappyDoge to further deliver value our launchpad systems are open to all other projects along as the community votes for it. By projects coming from the outside they will be paying a fee which will be held for the FlappyDoge treasury to either buy back and burn and expand developments of our ecosystem by creating new jobs for enthusiastic developers within the foreseeable future.
