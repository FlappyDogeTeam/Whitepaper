# Metaverse

The metaverse of FlappyDoge will be cartoony and plans to debute a trailer and possibly Beta by end of 2022. In the FlappyDoge metaverse ecosystem, you can  buy, sell, trade land, create on your land but what makes it stand out is that we will be bridging portals through a centralised system so an example can be FlappyDoge metaverse players log in using their wallet and in-game they go through a portal which will lead them into the another metaverse which that company/ token could be called X.&#x20;

With further expansion towards utility of FlappyDoge we will be faciliating meme projects that are decentralised to give them utility within our metaverse by creating games in which their users can earn FLPD or their own token.

The way we can do this is by bridging systems and folders together so players of 2 communities can talk. This bridge will be two way and will be in a long time beta phase but community can use it and register bug reports.&#x20;

As FlappyDoge grows, it will speed the development of an online Lobby that is VR enabled and can be played without VR, as well.  It will adapt previous successful concepts, like Club Penguin, with real NFTs and loot box marketplaces.

Other ways to earn and utilize FlappyDoge tokens will include, but not be limited to:

•             An online social structure where players can go against each other to see who can survive the longest and even wager additional amounts on the battle.

•             A Trophy Class system that represents the total amount of high score coins you collected.  Players thus earn additional rewards for elite gameplay.

•             Weekly and quarterly tournament play for players to compete.

•             Bonus elements as gameplay levels are extended

•             Easter Eggs

•             NFTs Loot Boxes

•             Online Lobby

•             VR Lobby
