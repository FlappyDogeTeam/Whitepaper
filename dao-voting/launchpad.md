# LaunchPad

The launchpad DAO voting system is based on community projects. Users must own 5000$ of equivalent of FLPD which users can vote on the next community game which incentivises the owners of FLPD.



The launchpad created will be used for FLPD holders, again what it will do is users must own 5000$ of FLPD to be whitelisted into community pre-sales users and also purchasing with BNB or equivalent in chosen stable coin.
