# Gameplay

FlappyDoge is a 3D game that will be released on iOS and Android with plans to integrate PC VR.

_**Mobile**_

FlappyDoge features ten levels with different background animation art. Players must run, fly, doge, slide through the obstacles , which at first is fairly simple; however, as levels increase, the speed and complexity increase and become even harder. To level up, one must complete the levels; in so doing, the user also earns rewards.

_**PC & VR**_

Part 2 of the game allows for using our newest NFT technology, particularly through leasing NFTs in our Market Place. The rewards withdrawn from the mobile app can be used on Market Place.

_**Play-2-Earn Rewards**_

A set number of coins can be collected per day which incentivizes the structure of withdrawing and collection. There is also a withdrawal limit per account, to help stabilize the value of the coins. To play, users can either play the free version to practice, or ante up some of their $FLPD to earn even more. Additional information regarding the P2E reward structure will be outlined later.

Further information regarding the Play 2 Earn reward structure will be outlined later
