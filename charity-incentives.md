# Charity Incentives

Users who have been scammed/rugged from past projects are incentivised to sell their scam project if they could and purchase $FLPD and hold for a total 3 months in which whatvever they hold is topped up 10%

Users will have to request a form from the official telegram group with proof and evidence that the wallet they purchased $FLPD they have in the past invested in a scam project in which a member of our team will investigate and highlight green with a timer.



A successful hodl of 3 months resulted in a 10% increase. Example. 1000 FLPD tokens have been purchased so in 3 months they will receive an extra 100FLPD as a gesture of goodwill for economic sustainability between our holders.

This action from FlappyDoge team is a gesture of goodwill and not a security but more as an example of charity.
