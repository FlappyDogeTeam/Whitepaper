# What is FlappyDoge

FlappyDoge, while being our first game, is also a Play2Earn (P2E) gaming company. Just like "Epic Games", we will release multiple games, but in FlappyDoge we do so with a DAO integration, so the community votes on what's best for the company in terms of deciding on which games get included into the ecosystem. All games would be used with $FLPD as the primary token for all projects/games to deliver value and utility.

FlappyDoge will also have an NFT/ Marketplace which will be integrated with web 3.0. We envision our users would be able to purchase skins and be able to trade those skins with other players within the marketplace.

Finally, as further described in the roadmap of FlappyDoge, in order to deliver more value, our launchpad systems are open to all other projects, so long as the community votes for it. The projects coming from the outside would pay a fee which would be held in the FlappyDoge treasury to either buy back and burn, or to expand developments of our ecosystem, by creating new jobs for enthusiastic developers within the foreseeable future.
